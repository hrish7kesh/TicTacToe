# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository contains a Java implementation of a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a square grid, aiming to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols.

## Features

- Customizable board size: Players can specify the size of the board, allowing for traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grids or larger grids for added complexity.
- Player names: Players can enter their names at the start of the game, adding a personalized touch to the gameplay.
- Intelligent gameplay: The game checks for valid moves, detects wins, and handles switching between players seamlessly.
- Simple interface: The game is played through the command-line interface, making it accessible and easy to play on any system.
